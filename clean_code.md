Naming Variables & Functions
Clarity Over Brevity, Avoid Abbreviations (Unless Universal), Avoid Generic Names
Classes → PascalCase
Functions → snake_case → get_user() NOT user()
Unchanging Values → UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Writing Small, Focused Functions
learn how to write functions that do exactly one thing, clearly and simply

Avoiding Code Duplication
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
repeated logic → put it in one function
use variables instead of repeating values
copy-paste the same block for multiple items (>2) → loop
