**Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**

I've used GitHub before for group projects, but it was mainly just as a platform where we could access shared uploaded files.



**Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**

Just GitHub.



**What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**

I was very impressed with how much thought has been put into Git. It’s especially necessary in organizations where multiple teams work on a large project. I learned how Git and GitHub work. I didn’t realize that Git is a command-line tool because GitHub has such an easy-to-use interface that you rarely need to go directly to the terminal.
